<h2> What the Authorities Don't Tell You </h2>

<p>
    Darknet markets are abstract to the general market. Some of us may have watched Mr. Robot. Others may have read about the arrest/jail sentencing of Ross Ulbricht AKA "Dreat Pirate Roberts" the creator/operator of Silk Road, which is estimated to have averaged $15 million in annual sales.

    If one were to visit a darknet market, he/she will find a thriving economic ecosystem that resembles Ebay while arguably solving more complex technical challenges like ensuring anonymity and creating trust among thieves.

    Up until 2019, one of the most prosperous darknet markets was the Wall Street Market (WSM). The market placed included approximately 5,400 vendors, tens of thousands of items/services for sale, and more than 1.1 million user accounts. At its apex, WSM was the second largest globak darknet market. In May 2019, in a covert collaboration among investigators from the United States, Germany, and Netherlands arrested four individuals in Germany for creating/operating the WSM. Upon arrest, the authorities seized more than 550k in euros.

We can apply topic modeling to understrand the structure of a transaction and descriptions of products if an intelligence agency would like to imitate a darkweb market participant.

    After authorities shut down WSM, the forum posts were shared with a number of univeristy research institutions. The corpus is comprised of more than 42,000 posts written by over 5,500 unique members. The posts were published between October 2016 and November 2018.

<h2> Exploring Parts Unkown </h2>

<p>
    The line chart below shows the daily number of posts during the life of the dataset. We see a significant uptick in October 2017. Given lack of transparency of the darknet, we can only speculate as to what caused this increase in participation.

<p>
    In July 2018, AlphaBay, which was one of the largest market at the time, was shut down by U.S., Canadian and Thailand law enforcement. It's possible that AlphaBay users/vendors migrated to Wall Street. The lag can partially be explained by the vetting process required of vendors and users to participate in
