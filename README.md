    Darknet markets are abstract to the general market. Some of us may have watched Mr. Robot. Others may have read about the arrest/jail sentencing of Ross Ulbricht AKA "Dreat Pirate Roberts" the creator/operator of Silk Road, which is estimated to have averaged $15 million in annual sales.

    If one were to visit a darknet market, he/she will find a thriving economic ecosystem that resembles Ebay while arguably solving more complex technical challenges like ensuring anonymity and creating trust among thieves.

    Up until 2019, one of the most prosperous darknet markets was the Wall Street Market (WSM). The market placed included approximately 5,400 vendors, tens of thousands of items/services for sale, and more than 1.1 million user accounts. In May 2019, in a covert collaboration among investigators from the United States, Germany, and Netherlands arrested four individuals in Germany for creating/operating the WSM. Upon arrest, the authorities seized more than 550k in euros.
